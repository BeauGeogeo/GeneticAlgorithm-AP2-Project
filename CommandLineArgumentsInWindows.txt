This is a quick guide on how to launch a python script through command line in Windows 10 that you might find
usefull. An exemple is given to figurate how it works concretely.

First, go in the command line C:\WINDOWS\system32>

Then change the directory and fill the line with the path to your python like this :

C:\WINDOWS\system32>cd C:\Users\Geoffrey\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Python 3.7

Now the terminal should display : 

C:\Users\Geoffrey\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Python 3.7>

Now, add python.exe, the path to your script and the arguments required to execute it correctly. For example, 
with the function problem and so the main_function.py script, it results in :  

C:\Users\Geoffrey\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Python 3.7> D:\PushToGit\GeneticAlgorithm-AP2-Project\src\main_files\main_function.py 20 30 0.05 10 3 5

The script should be run correctly, as if you were using a .bat files from the fast_launchers directory.
